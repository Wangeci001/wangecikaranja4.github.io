        <p>Hi, I‚Äôm <strong>Wangeci Karanja</strong> from Kenya. I‚Äôm 22 years old and currently pursuing a Diploma in Information Communication Technology at NYS College. I‚Äôm a go-getter with an unshakable zeal for life, driven by the desire to be the greatest and to continuously better myself every day ‚Äî making sure I‚Äôm proud of who I am.</p>
        <p>I have always loved storytelling and enjoy acting as a profession, as it allows me to express creativity and connect with others in meaningful ways. My passion for technology has led me to develop skills in web development, creating dynamic and user-friendly websites. Additionally, as a life coach, I empower others to achieve their goals and live fulfilling lives through guidance and motivation. My educational journey began in the early 2000s, and I completed my high school education in 2019 before joining NYS in 2022.</p>
        <p>Outside of writing, acting, coding, and coaching, I enjoy listening to music, watching movies, reading, and playing table tennis. I‚Äôm also a lover at heart, deeply inspired by my parents, who motivate me every step of the way.</p>
        <p>My mission as a writer, actor, web developer, and life coach is to inspire change and motivate lives through my work. Please follow me on my social media handles on the contacts page and get to experience my lifestyle. I live by the motto: <em>‚ÄúSurviving is winning.‚Äù</em></p>
